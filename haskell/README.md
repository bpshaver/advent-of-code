# Advent of Code in Haskell

## 2023 Day 6

List comprehension and filter, refactored to use quadratic equation to find roots for polynomial.

```bash
$ ghc aoc.hs
$ time ./aoc
./aoc  2.04s user 0.01s system 93% cpu 2.188 total
```

After refactoring:

```bash
$ ghc aoc.hs
$ time ./2306
./aoc  0.00s user 0.00s system 4% cpu 0.146 total
```

## 2023 Day 9

Easy recursive solution. Focused on readability and trying some simple basic unit tests.

```bash
$ time runghc aoc.hs
1762065988
1066
runghc aoc.hs  0.19s user 0.09s system 70% cpu 0.403 total
```
